Udacity, in an attempt at making students get more familiar with paper-reading and synthesize the most relevant ideas from a scientific reading, encourage us to write some research reviews as part of the project delivery. This repository is an effort of continuing this discipline. For now, it only contains reviews made from some relevant papers, and it is expected to grow gradually.
